Hi, I'm Janpol Hidalgo,
Like most devs, it started with curiosity.
One moment I was just clicking stuff,
next thing I know I’m knee-deep in console logs and late-night
"why isn't this working?!" breakdowns 😭.
Still on the grind, always learning,
and lowkey building my own multiverse of apps one bug at a time.
Not perfect, but built diff.
