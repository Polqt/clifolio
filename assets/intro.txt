Greetings, Traveler.

You have encountered Janpol Hidalgo, the Dev-Warrior.

Like all warriors, my journey began with a simple quest—
curiosity led me through the terminal gates.
What started as exploration became a calling.

Now I traverse digital realms, wielding code as my weapon,
debugging as my battle strategy,
and every project a new conquest.

Still forging my path, sharpening my skills,
building kingdoms of applications one line at a time.

Not perfect. But battle-tested.
Ready to embark on the next quest?
