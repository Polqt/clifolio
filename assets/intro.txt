    Greetings, Traveler.

    You have encountered Janpol Hidalgo, the Dev-Warrior.

    My journey started with curiosity and a terminal window.
    What began as small experiments slowly turned into real quests.

    I explore digital worlds using code as my main tool,
    solving problems, fixing bugs, and building projects along the way.
    Each project is a new challenge, and each mistake helps me level up.

    I’m still learning, still improving, and still on my path.
    Not a max-level hero yet—but gaining experience every day.
